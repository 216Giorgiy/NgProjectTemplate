This template adds an Angular CLI application to an existing ASP.NET Core project.

This is an item template, not a project template. 
To create an Angular CLI application as a stand-alone project, with no server-side code, use the project template that comes with this template in the same Visual Studio Extension.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you selected the "Add automatically" option in the template wizard, this item template would do the following:

* Run "ng new {projectName} --directory . --routing --skip-git --skip-install" in the projects root directory.

* If an existing package.json is found, merge the package.json file generated by Angular CLI with it.
The actual installation of the npm packages does not happen at the time of the application creation, it happens on next build of the project.

* If an existing .gitignore file is found, append Angular CLI entries to it.

* Add NuGet package AfominDotCom.AspNetCore.AngularCLI to the project.

* Modify the existing Startup.cs file. Add statement "using AfominDotCom.AspNetCore.AngularCLI;" at the beginning of the file
and add the following code snippet at the beginning of the Configure method:

if (env.IsDevelopment())
{
  app.RunNgServe("--base-href /my-ng-app/");
}

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The "/my-ng-app/" path specified as a parameter in the app.RunNgServe call, is a relative path.
For example, if your main ASP.NET Core website runs at http://localhost:12345, the Angular app will be found at http://localhost:12345/my-ng-app
Requests to that relative path will be proxied to the standard NG Development Server launched from the ASP.NET Core code. 
Please note, the proxy is used during development only. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a production build, add the same option "--base-href /my-ng-app/" to the "build" script in package.json. 
Point the output of the build to the "my-ng-app" subfolder within the wwwroot directory using the "--output-path" option.
During a Build of the project, MSBuild looks up a script name in package.json corresponding to the Build Configuration, and if found, executes it. 
For example, it expects script names "build:Debug" and "build:Release", or some other depending on your custom Configuration name. 
If no corresponding script name found, the default "build" script is executed.
